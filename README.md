# DoOne

## About the Project

### Purpose

It happens that a person for multiple reasons (too much work, too busy, students, small budgets,...) does not have time for himself or to think about doing new activities.
It is in this context that we decided to create DoOne.
<br />
<br />
DoOne is a mobile application that proposes one activity per day in order to make the user happier.
<br />
<br />
Our project goal is to bring one moment of happiness in the day of our user by giving him the choice to realise one healthy activity between 3 each day. Those activities will be easy to realise and aim to help him doing one nice thing every day.
<br />
All of our activity will be separated into themes which we think are important in the realisation of anyone. Themes for example can be : cultural, sport, take care of the family, take care of friends, do something manual etc...
<br />
<br />
DoOne will help everyone who is interested in doing one good thing every day that he may not have thought of.
<br />
<br />
This project is neither a complete life coach or a directory of different activities, it’s between the two.
